# ROS and spatial algebra semantics

When looking up transformation on ROS `tf`, keep in mind that if you want a transformation $$^{A}X^{B}$$, (read as transformation from the frame $$A$$ to frame $$B$$), then the way you would articulate the lookup in `lookup_transform` function in `tf` would be 

```python
buf = tf2_ros.Buffer()
tf_listener = tf2_ros.TransformListener(buf)
transform = buf.lookup_transform(A, B, rospy.Time(0))
```

Don’t let the target to source terminology confuse you here. More about [this](https://answers.ros.org/question/330580/tf2-listener-transform-has-child_frame_id-as-the-source-and-frame_id-as-the-target/). The above function returns the transformation $$^{A}X^{B}$$.

In [Tedrake’s Robotic Manipulation](https://manipulation.csail.mit.edu/pick.html#section3), the usual notation has a target frame (say G), reference frame(say F) and a expressed in frame (say F again). The expressed in frame is dropped when talking about pure rotations and transformations, $$R, X$$.

$$
^{F}X^{ G}, 
^{F}R^{ G}, ^{F}p^{ G}_{ F}
$$

In ROS, the main message used to depict transformations is the `TransformStamped` message. This has attributes `frame_id` and `child_frame_id`. Then in Tedrake’s notation the transformation extracted from the above `ros` functionality is as follows.

$$
^{frame\_id}X^{ child\_frame\_id}
$$
